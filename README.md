## Initial Setup

1. **Grant Accessibility Permission**:
   - The app will request Accessibility permission on first launch
   - Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
   - Find AnyDrag in the list and check the box next to it

2. **Menu Bar Icon**:
   - When the app is running, an icon will appear in the menu bar
   - Click the icon to control the service

## Usage

1. **Window Dragging**:
   - Hold the Cmd key
   - Move your mouse
   - The window under the mouse will automatically follow
   - Release the Cmd key to stop dragging
   - Windows instantly come to front across all monitors when Cmd is pressed

2. **Menu Controls**:
   - **Start/Stop**: Enable/disable the service
   - **Accessibility Permission**: Check permission status
   - **How to Use**: View help information
   - **Launch at Login**: Enable/disable automatic startup
   - **Quit**: Completely exit the application

## Auto-Launch at Startup

To make the app automatically run at system startup:

1. Click the menu bar icon
2. Check "Launch at Login" option
3. This will create a launch agent in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` directory

To manually disable:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ufukozen.AnyDrag.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ufukozen.AnyDrag.plist
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **NSApplication**: Runs as a background service
- **WindowDragManager**: Global event monitoring and window manipulation
- **MenuBarManager**: Menu bar control and user interface
- **BackgroundService**: Service coordination and lifecycle management

### Permissions Required
- **Accessibility**: Required to modify window positions and bring windows to front
- **Global Event Monitoring**: Required to monitor Cmd key and mouse movements

### Performance Optimizations
- Event throttling (~120 FPS) for optimal performance
- Window cache system for fast window detection
- Minimal CPU and memory usage
- Multi-monitor coordinate system handling

### Multi-Monitor Support
- Global window bring-to-front across all monitors
- Proper coordinate system conversion between Cocoa and Quartz
- PID-based application activation for reliable cross-monitor focus
- NSWorkspace integration for system-level window management

## Troubleshooting

### Accessibility Permission Issues
```bash
# Check permission status
sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db "SELECT * FROM access WHERE service='kTCCServiceAccessibility';"

# Restart the application
killall AnyDrag
```

### Launch Agent Issues
```bash
# Check launch agent status
launchctl list | grep com.ufukozen.AnyDrag

# Manual loading
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ufukozen.AnyDrag.plist
```

### Debug Mode
Run the app from terminal to see debug output:
```bash
/path/to/AnyDrag.app/Contents/MacOS/AnyDrag
```

### Multi-Monitor Issues
If windows don't come to front properly across monitors:
1. Ensure Accessibility permission is granted
2. Try restarting the service from menu bar
3. Check Console.app for any error messages
